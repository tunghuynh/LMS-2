## 🚨 Important Reminders

1. **NO custom CSS in pages** - Use only existing components
2. **NO hardcoded text** - Everything must use t('key')
3. **NO business data in localStorage** - Only preferences
4. **ALL data from JSON files** - With mock delays
5. **MUST support both themes** - Test continuously
6. **MUST be fully responsive** - Test all breakpoints
7. **MUST complete Phase 0 first** - No exceptions

---

## 📝 Notes Section

### Architecture Decisions
- Iframe structure chosen for better isolation
- Component-first approach ensures consistency
- Translation system built early for easier adoption
- Mock API layer allows easy backend integration later

### Known Constraints
- No real backend in Phase I
- Email notifications are simulated
- File uploads stored in localStorage (size limits)
- Search is client-side only

### Future Considerations (Phase II+)
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Advanced quiz types (code, drawing)
- Video conferencing integration
- Mobile app considerations
- Microservices architecture
