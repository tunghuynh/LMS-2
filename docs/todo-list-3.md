## 🚨 Important Reminders (Enhanced)

### Development Guidelines
1. **NO custom CSS in pages** - Use only existing components from Phase 0
2. **NO hardcoded text** - Everything must use t('translation.key')
3. **NO business data in localStorage** - Only user preferences (theme, language)
4. **ALL data from JSON files** - With realistic mock delays (200-800ms)
5. **MUST support both themes** - Test continuously during development
6. **MUST be fully responsive** - Test all breakpoints (mobile-first)
7. **MUST complete Phase 0 first** - No exceptions to foundation-first approach

### Quality Standards
8. **Accessibility First** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
9. **Performance Targets** - Page load < 2s, smooth interactions
10. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation and helpful error messages
11. **Code Quality** - Clean, documented, maintainable code
12. **Cross-Browser** - Support latest 2 versions of major browsers
